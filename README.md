# Challenge22
Challenge 22 of the Java online course from programmieren-starten.de

1st iteration of an exception handling practice about selling juice and checking the temperature of the drinks...
This iteration is... Yikes... I need to code more frequently, can't afford another 1 week of standing still.
Will repeat the current module of the course and do better.
